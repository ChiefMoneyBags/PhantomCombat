1.11-SNAPSHOT
- updated file library
- pvp toggle now checks for projectiles and splash potions


1.12.0-SNAPSHOT:
notes:
- settings version increased to 8
changes:
- added 'commands to execute from console when a player logs out during combat mode'
- the plugin will delay the death coordinates message by a quarter of a second so it is visible after the death message spam
- changes and fixes to 'block flight'
 - now turns off flight when you enter combat.
 - saves 'allow flight' state before you enter into combat. after you finish combat, if you were allowed to fly, you can start flying again.
- updated libraries (LightningStorage 3.0.9)
- added check if player is online during combat mode task to prevent possible NPE
- added changelog file to github repo
- fixed dropped items showing blood in lava
other notes:
- sorry for lack of updates
- added digit to plugin version for very minor changes (build number)


1.13.0-SNAPSHOT:
notes: []
changes:
- added 'isCancelled' check to all events (where possible) before they do anything
 - Should make it so players hitting players in a protected area not put them in combat
- several code changes (i'm surprised how far i've differed from my old coding styles)
 - renamed classes to better names (LBlood -> BloodListener)
 - removed statics everywhere! yay
 - better file lib usage:
  - half of the plugin's code now uses 'defaults', so there will be less NPEs from a bad config
  - the other half I will get to later :)
 - other code cleanup I forgot to write here.

- Updated 'settings.yml' + increased its version to 9
- Added 'remove combat on gamemode switch' so admins switching to creative mode no longer have combat mode on (allows them to fly as well)
- Fixed missing file defaults in 'CombatModeListener', still need to fix the defaults in the classes 'DeathCoordsListener', 'GracePeriodListener', 'PvPSettingsListener', 'PvPToggleListener' and 'StatsListener'.
